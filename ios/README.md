# PranaVeda for iOS (prototype)

A SwiftUI prototype of the native iPhone app: Amrita's chat streaming from the
existing `/api/chat` (as a guest, with the wellness profile kept on the
device), ritual, breathwork, dosha and answer-option cards, and a Library of
every pose from `/api/catalog` with Niral's room scenes. Sign-in is not in it
yet.

## Requirements

- Xcode 27 with an iOS 17 or later simulator runtime (`xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS`)
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`)
- The PranaVeda server running locally (`npm run dev` in the repo root, with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set)

## Build and run

The Xcode project is generated from `project.yml`, so it is not committed:

```bash
cd ios
xcodegen
open PranaVeda.xcodeproj
```

Run the `PranaVeda` scheme on an iPhone simulator. The simulator reaches the
Mac's own `localhost`, so the app talks to the local server at
`http://localhost:3000`. To point it elsewhere, change `PV_API_BASE_URL` in
`project.yml` (or pass `PV_API_BASE_URL=…` to `xcodebuild`).

Tests (stream parsing and decoding of the server's events and cards):

```bash
xcodebuild -project PranaVeda.xcodeproj -scheme PranaVeda -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 18 Pro' test
```

## Notes

- Plain `http` is allowed for the local network only (`NSAllowsLocalNetworking`); everything else needs https.
- Image addresses from the API are either full addresses or site paths (`/poses/cobra.jpg`); paths are resolved against the API's address (`AppConfig.resolve`).
- The web app's fonts (Playfair Display, Plus Jakarta Sans) are not bundled yet; the system serif and sans stand in.
